# Welcome to the Swansea University IEEE Student Branch

The Swansea University IEEE Student Branch is a student-led initiative dedicated to connecting students within and across faculties, universities and colleges with a wider network of IEEE professionals and peers. Our main goal is to provide the opportunity for aspiring scientists, engineers and technologists to collaborate in a stimulating and vibrant environment fostering interpersonal communication, knowledge sharing and reciprocal support. Our branch provides opportunities to collaborate with fellow IEEE Student and Graduate Student Members, engage with industry experts, and develop critical skills beyond the classroom. 

Join the IEEE student branch to become an active part of the team and enrich your academic journey through inspiring workshops, networking events, and hands-on projects!

## üìö 3rd Reading Clinic: Tuesday 18th February 3-4 pm - CoFo 014

As part of our first commitment to the branch, we have created the Reading Clinics, weekly reading meetings offering students the opportunity to read and discuss academic papers in a group environment. Our second session will focus on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for Biomedical Images Segmentation, led by Sarah Costa and will take place on:

üìÖ Tuesday, 18th February
üïí 3:00 ‚Äì 4:00 PM
üìç CoFo 014 (Ground Floor, Computational Foundry)

A link to the two academic papers which will be discussed in the session is provided below:

1) [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation | Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention | Springer Nature](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28)

2) [Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation | Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01018-x)

Join us to engage in insightful discussions, network with fellow IEEE members, and enhance your academic journey. We are looking forward to seeing you there!
