# Welcome to the Swansea University IEEE Student Branch

The Swansea University IEEE Student Branch is a student-led initiative dedicated to connecting students within and across faculties, universities and colleges with a wider network of IEEE professionals and peers. Our main goal is to provide the opportunity for aspiring scientists, engineers and technologists to collaborate in a stimulating and vibrant environment fostering interpersonal communication, knowledge sharing and reciprocal support. Our branch provides opportunities to collaborate with fellow IEEE Student and Graduate Student Members, engage with industry experts, and develop critical skills beyond the classroom. 

Join us to become an active part of the branch and enrich your academic journey through inspiring workshops, networking events, and hands-on projects!


## Reading Clinic: Monday 3rd February 3-4 pm - CoFo 014

As part of our first commitment to the branch, we have created the Reading Clinics, weekly reading meetings offering students the opportunity to read and discuss academic papers in a group environment. Our first meeting will be on Monday the 3rd of February (3-4 pm) in CoFo 014 (ground floor) and will be focused on Design Thinking Methodology (DMT). A link to the three academic papers which will be discussed in the session is provided below:

1) [LLMs in Design Thinking: Autoethnographic Insights and Design Implications](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3631991.3631999)

2) [Design Thinking for Human Centric Research Data Systems Engineering | Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing 2024: Human Powered Computing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3626203.3670542)

3) [TECH TO MARKET.
